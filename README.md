# TechCrunch-WebScraper
The crawler.py script allows you to scrape TechCrunch articles and save them locally. It utilizes the requests library for making HTTP requests, a custom Scraper class for handling the article URLs, and a TechCrushParser class for parsing the HTML content of each article. Successfully tested on both Windows and macOS using Python 3.9.
